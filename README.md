# pandas-challenge
Instruction and notes:
My code is a big mess to read (sorry about this) BUT I got most of the answers.
There are only a few lines that do not run, but it will not interfer with the rest. The lines that do not run are because I was trying to figure out how to calculate some average. It did not work.
Purchasing Analysis (Age) is missing a column as well as Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

I tried making everythign easier to read, but it just mess everythign up and was not runnign.

Again sorry for the mess. Happy reading :) 

PS: My analysis will be found in a pdf file
